# Sales Dashboard Project (Tableau)

## Overview

This project was created during my free time as a way to strengthen my portfolio and further develop my skills in data analytics using Tableau. I wanted to replicate a real-world business scenario by working with messy data that required cleaning, restructuring, and thoughtful visualization. My goal was to transform raw, unorganized information into a clear and insightful dashboard that could effectively support decision-making.

## Dataset and Objective

The dataset used includes fictional sales data covering various product categories, customer segments, and geographic regions. I selected this dataset because real-world data is rarely clean, and I wanted to challenge myself to work through the complications that arise during analysis. The primary objective was to build a dashboard that answers six key business questions related to sales performance, customer value, product trends, and geographic distribution.

## Dashboard Design and Insights

The final dashboard was designed to answer the following business questions:

1. What are total sales by category and sub-category?
2. Who are the top 10 customers by total sales?
3. What are total sales by month in the most recent year?
4. What is the geographical distribution of sales across regions or states?
5. What are the total sales by segment and discount usage?
6. What are the top-selling products or product trends?

To support these questions, I created a combination of charts including bar graphs, pie charts, and time-series visualizations. I also added KPI cards displaying total sales, the number of distinct customers, and total order volume. These help viewers quickly grasp the key performance metrics at a glance.

## Process and Learnings

Throughout this project, I learned how to create and apply calculated fields, design KPI cards, and customize dashboard layouts. One of the biggest challenges I faced was overcrowding—trying to fit all necessary elements while maintaining a clean and readable design. I spent time experimenting with layout options and spacing to ensure the dashboard remained functional and visually balanced.

What I’m most proud of is the clarity and overall professionalism of the dashboard. Despite working with complex and unstructured data, the final product is intuitive and easy to navigate, which reflects real business needs.

## Future Improvements

If I were to extend this dashboard in the future, I would add more KPIs such as year-over-year growth. I would also like to implement more interactivity, such as drill-downs into customer or product details and dynamic filtering across views. These additions would enhance both the usability and analytical depth of the dashboard.
